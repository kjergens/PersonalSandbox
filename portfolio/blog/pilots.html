           Pilots used to look like this:
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/ruggedpilot.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Planes in the 1910s and 20s were unsafe, and pilots had to be tough. With this toughness came assumptions about their personalities as carefree adventurers with machismo to spare.</p>

 <figure><img src="images/pilots/airmailpilots.jpg-original" alt="" /><figcaption>Airmail pilots in the 1920s.</figcaption>
</figure>

 <p>Fortune magazine described the US Air Mail pilots: </p>
 
           
           <blockquote>"When they play poker they play all night. When they smoke they smoke too much. When they drink their glasses leak, and when they make love  complaints are rare."
            </blockquote>
  
          <figure><img src="images/pilots/satevenpost.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Magazines promoted the image of the rugged pilot.</figcaption></figure>
          <p>This image was fun but it was bad news for plane manufacturers. Planes were not just for the US Mail. In the 1920s they started pushing to sell them to individuals. But people didn't feel safe thinking planes could only be managed by these rugged broncos.</p>


          <p>So the airplane and oil companies deliberately re-imagined pilots. The new pilots looked like this:</p>
  


 <figure><img src="images/pilots/prettypilot2.png" alt="" /><figure>The new pilots were feminine, stylish, healthy and optimistic.</figure></figure>

  <p>Plane companies took out ads to circulate the image of young woman flying for leisure. They sponsored flights by woman aviators followed by radio interviews, turning them into stars.</p>

   <p>
The Ladies Aeronautical Society proclaimed:</p>
  <blockquote>"There is no finer past-time for a respectable young woman than to get out in the fresh air and exercise mind and body in the pursuit of the mechanodynamic sciences of flight!"</blockquote>

    <img src="images/pilots/Flying_Pat_poster.jpg" style="display:inline;height:250px" />
    <figcaption>Movies, newspapers, and magazines reinforced the image and helped create the celebrity aviatrix.</figcaption>
  </figure>




   <p>The image worked. Planes were perceived as safe and the image gave rise to a popular Hollywood character: the Aviatrix</p>

   <figure><img src="images/pilots/ads.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>The image became so popular it was used to sell cigarettes, gum, clothing and engine oil.</figcaption></figure>

          <p>But once again, the image was not good news to everyone. By the 1950s commercial airlines were established. They didn't think they could sell tickets with the image of a young woman at the helm. So, again the pilot was re-imagined. </p>

          <p>Airline companies hired and trained according to a new specific image: The pilot was now male and thin. He wore a business to look professional and a naval cap to look heroic. The final touch was an intercom: a faceless voice of authority. The pilot was now a father figure.</p>

          <figure><img src="images/pilots/luckystrike1958.png" alt="" /><figcaption>By 1958, cigarette ads used the new image of the airline pilot.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This latest pilot image has endured for over 50 years.</p>
