           Pilots used to be portrayed like this: 
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/ruggedpilot.jpg" alt="" /></figure>


 <figure><img src="images/pilots/airmailpilots.jpg-original" alt="" /></figure>
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/satevenpost.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
           "When they played poker they played all night. When they smoked they smoked too much. When they made love the complaints were rare."
          </p>
          <p>But that was bad news for plane manufacturers. Planes were originally small and sold to individuals, like a car. No one felt safe if it was the vehicle of these rugged broncos.</p>


          <p>Then they looked like this:</p>
  
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/prettypilot.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>Flying was advertised as a pasttime for young women.</figcaption></figure>

  <figure><img src="images/pilots/flapper.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption></figcaption></figure>

   <figure><img src="images/pilots/prettywaving.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
 

  <figure><img src="images/pilots/pilotcolorized.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption></figcaption></figure>
  
  
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/prettypilot2.png" alt="" /><figure>The new pilots were clean, crisp, stylish, healthy and optimistic.</figure></figure>
   
   
   <figure><img src="images/pilots/smokingwoman.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Cigarette, gum, clothing and oil companies used the Aviatrix image in their ads.</figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src="images/pilots/camelwoman.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Cigarette, gum, clothing and oil companies used the Aviatrix image in their ads.</figcaption></figure>

          <p> Aviatrix. There were more women pilots in the 1920s than today. Ladies Aeronautical Society. No finer past-time for a respectable young woman than to get out in the fresh air and exercise mind and body in the pursuit of the mechanodynamic sciences of flight!</p>

          <p>Airplane companies wanted to sell the idea of planes are so safe and easy to use. These women look like they won't get dirty at all. It became a popular Hollywood character: the Aviatrix</p>

          <p>This didn't work so well for commercial airlines. The Aviatrixes helped refine the activity of flying, but no one would pay big bucks to have Betty on her spring break from university fly you. If it was easy, its not an expensive service. If it's hard, Betty shouldn't be the pilot.</p>

          <p>So they went through a very deliberate process of re-imaging the pilot. Professional (the business suit), trained (the naval cap and pins), a distant father figure (the intercom). Betty was now the co-pilot, then later the flight attendent.</p>

          <figure><img src="images/pilots/panampilots.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Promotional PanAm photo. 1950s.</figcaption></figure>
          <figure><img src="images/pilots/luckystrike1958.png" alt="" /><figcaption>By 1958, cigarette ads used the new image of the airline pilot.</figcaption></figure>

          <p>It worked. People rated airline pilot as top profession until astronauts took over. The planes barely changed. Which is why this article is called Image is Everything.</p>

          <p>With the enclosed, furnished cabin and improved communication, piloting became easier. Yet the airlines sold the idea that these plane were more difficult and dangerous than the aircrafts of the 1920s' aviatrixes.</p>
