           Pilots used to look like this:
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/ruggedpilot.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

 <p>They were rough and tough and if you were around in the 1910s you wouldn't mess with them.</p>

 <p>Fortune magazine said this about US Air Mail pilots: </p>
 
           
           <blockquote>"When they play poker they play all night. When they smoke they smoke too much. When they drink their glasses leak, and when they make love  complaints are rare."
            </blockquote>

<p>In the 1920s things changed. Plane manufacturers wanted to sell to individuals, not just the air mail corps and the military. But the tough pilot image made planes look scary and dangerous.</p>

          <p>Airplane manufacturers needed the public to have a different image of pilots if they had any hope of selling their machines. So they took out magazine ads and sponsored cross-oceanic flights. All their pilots looked something like this:</p>

   <img src="images/pilots/Radio-poster-300.jpg" style="display:inline;width:48%" />
    <figcaption>In the 1920s and '30s, plane and engine oil companies sponsored flights by young women so flying would seem safe.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The image stuck and flying was perceived as a safe and fun activity.
The Ladies Aeronautical Society proclaimed:</p>
  <blockquote>"There is no finer past-time for a respectable young woman than to get out in the fresh air and exercise mind and body in the pursuit of the mechanodynamic sciences of flight!"</blockquote>

     <img src="images/pilots/amelia-earhart-lucky-strike-ad-1929.jpg" style="display:inline;width:50%" />
    <figcaption>The image became so popular it was used to sell cigarettes, movies, and clothing.</figcaption></figure>

    <p>But by the 1950s things changed again.</p>

    <p> Commercial airlines became a booming business and the idea that the plane is a toy for a young woman contradicted the message airlines wanted to send: planes are a complicated piece of machinery and you need US to fly them for you. </p>

    <p>So once again the pilot was re-imagined. </p>

    <p>Airlines groomed their pilots to fit a specific image. He was male and thin. He wore a business suit to look professional and a naval cap to look responsible. Lastly, he spoke over an intercom: a faceless voice of authority. The pilot was now a father figure.</p>

          <figure><img src="images/pilots/luckystrike1958.png" alt="" /><figcaption>By 1958, cigarette ads used the new image of the airline pilot.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This latest pilot image has endured for over 60 years.</p>
