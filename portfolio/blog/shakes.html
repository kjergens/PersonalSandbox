            Ok, so you might not have been thinking about Shakespeare's bedroom. But now that you are, chances are you are picturing shades of brown, black, and gray. Because it was the 16th century and people in the past lived without colors, right?

          <figcaption>Most people envision 16th century homes in drab colors like this 1903 depiction of Shakespeare's home (artist unknown).</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Until the year 2000, the curators of Shakepeare's birthplace decorated it without color.</figcaption>

          <p>
            Until recently, that's what the curators of Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon thought. They decorated the tourist destination with white walls, gray linens, and bare wooden bedposts. </p>

            <p>
            In 2000, they discovered that most middle-class families of the day, including Shakespeare's, decorated their homes with painted cloths and vibrant linens.
         Colors were a sign a wealth, and anyone who could afford it showed them off. His birthplace and adult homes have been redecorated in the rich colors that probably surrounded him all his life. Lucky man!</p>

          <figcaption>This room looks like a bedroom but was actually a sitting room. The bed was for show, as were the brightest colors in the house.</figcaption>
