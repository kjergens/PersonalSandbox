      <p>In the beginning, accountants were seen as moral heros, people doing God's work and making society better. Given the recent <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87293">clashes between ethics and accounting</a>, this might sound strange. But it makes sense when you consider what came before.</p>

Courtesty of the National Gallery of Art.</div><figcaption>The Dutch are credited with inventing the accounting profession (as opposed to personal accounting, <a href="quipu.html">which has been around for centuries</a>). In the 16th century Dutch artists glorifed accountants, a practice British artists picked up during the Industrial Revolution two centuries later.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Before accounting, monarchies spent money without keeping track of it. Kings felt it was beneath them to keep records or answer to anyone. When they ran out of money, they simply collected more taxes. But in the 16th century, the Dutch, who are credited with inventing modern accounting, started a revolution. They audited the books, and by doing so they introduced something the monarchies hadn't encounterd before: transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>It was seen as a civic duty, with most Dutch civilians fluent in accounting practices which they learned in publicly funded schools.</p>

<p>The profession grew very slowly over the next several centuries, but by the late 19th century businesses saw its value and the profession took off. In only 60 years (1870-1930), the number of accountants/book-keepers in the U.S. increased from circa 54,000 workers [U.S. Census Office, 1872, p. 706] to more than 900,000 [U.S. Bureau
 of the Census, 1933, Tables 3, 49].</p>

Arther Young (right) studied law in Scotland but moved to New York city in 1890 to pursue a career in accounting, eventually starting a firm with his brother. The two men died within days of each other in 1948, never having met. Their firms were later merged into Ernst & Young.</figcaption></figure>


<p>At first bookkeeping and accounting were tightly connected, with bookkeeping being an apprenticeship to accounting. Bookkeeping was a respectable profession that could lead to an accounting career and even owning your own business.</p>

<p>But the mechanization of accounting from 1916-1930 changed this. Bookkeeping became the routine task of entering data with a machine, while accounting focussed on interpretting the data and making managerial recommendations. Accounting became a profession while bookkeeping became a trade.(Wooden and Kemmerer: U.S. Mechanical Accounting)</p>

During the period of mechanization (1916-1930), bookkeeping shifted to women's work that no longer led to an accounting career.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The professionalization of accounting kept people without certificates or degrees out of the profession, and since many colleges did not offer accounting courses to women, accounting and bookkeeping became genderized. </p>

 <p>Men remained the majority of accountants until 1997, when women accounted for 54 percent of accounting graduates and 51 percent of new hires in public accounting firms (AICPA, 1998). (Hardin-Reding-Stocks, Journal of Managerial Issues Summer 2002)</p>



<figure><img src="images/accounting/woman.jpg"><figcaption>Today the majority of accountants are women. It is still a profession requiring a degree. The profession is in a stage of rebuilding its reputation, which was tarnished in the past few decades due ethical violations by big firms.</figcaption></figure>
