      <p>In the beginning, accountants were the people's heros, doing God's work and improving day-to-day life. Given the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87293">ethical violations in recent years</a> this might sound strange. But it makes sense when you consider what came before.</p>


<p>Before accountants, monarchs spent without keeping records. They often didn't even know how much money they had. When they ran out they simply collected more taxes. </p>

<p>In the 16th century the Dutch changed that. The Dutch pioneered international trade, and with that they started recording how much was taken in and how much was going out. This had been going on in people's households for centuries, but it was a first for business and government. With these new record keeping books monarchs were faced with something hadn't encountered before: transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>It was a revolution. Everyone - even the king - was subject to the spending records. It was no longer in God's hands or the king's will how much taxes would be collected. It was a major step toward representative government.</p>

<p>Accounting was seen as a civic duty, professional accountants were respected and most Dutch civilians learned accounting in publicly funded schools.</p>

<p>It was slow to spread to other countries, which for the next few centuries held on to loose financial policies. But when the Industrial Revolution hit in the turn of the last century, increasing production and internationl trade, accounting took off. In only 60 years (1870-1930), the number of accountants/book-keepers in the U.S. increased from circa 54,000 workers [U.S. Census Office, 1872, p. 706] to more than 900,000 [U.S. Bureau
 of the Census, 1933, Tables 3, 49].</p>

Arther Young (right) studied law in Scotland but moved to New York city in 1890 to pursue a career in accounting, eventually starting a firm with his brother. The two men died within days of each other in 1948, never having met. Their firms were later merged into Ernst & Young.</figcaption></figure>


<p>In the early American days of accounting, you started out as a bookkeeper and worked your way up. But the mechanization of accounting from 1916-1930 changed this. Accounting machines turned bookkeeping into a routine task of entering data, leaving no time to learn accounting principles. Meanwhile, accountants stayed away from data-entry and soley focussed in interpretting the data. By the 1920s the census listed them as separate occupations.</p>

Photo courtesy the Early Office Museum</div><figcaption> During the period of mechanization (1916-1930), bookkeeping shifted to women's work that no longer led to an accounting career.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Without bookkeeping as a training ground, accountants trained in schools. Certificates and degrees were introduced to validate someone's accounting knowledge. This professionalization narrowed the field to the college-educated and mostly men, since many colleges did not offer accounting courses to women.</p>

 <p>Men remained the majority of accountants until 1997, when women took over, accounting for 54 percent of accounting graduates and 51 percent of new hires in public accounting firms (AICPA, 1998). (Hardin-Reding-Stocks, Journal of Managerial Issues Summer 2002)</p>



<figure><img src="images/accounting/woman.jpg"><figcaption>Today the majority of accountants are women. It is still a profession requiring a degree. The profession is in a stage of rebuilding its reputation, which was tarnished in the past few decades due ethical violations by big firms.</figcaption></figure>
