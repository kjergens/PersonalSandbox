      <p>In the beginning, accountants were seen as moral heros, doing God's work and making society better. Given the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87293">ethical violations in recent years</a>, this might sound strange. But it makes sense when you consider what came before.</p>

<figure><img src="images/accounting/jan.jpg" width="500px" /><div class="citation">Jan Gossaert

<p>Before accountants, monarchs would spend money without keeping track of it. Kings felt it was beneath them to keep records or answer to anyone. When they ran out of money they simply collected more taxes. </p>

<p>But in the 16th century the Dutch changed that. They started recording how much was taken in and how much was going out, not just in their personal finances, but in business and government. By doing so they introduced something monarchs hadn't encountered before: transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>It was a revolution. Everyone - even the king - was accountable to the spending records. It was a step toward equality and fair government. Accounting gave the people a new form of freedom. Freedom from secrets and unquestioned authority. It spread like wildfire. It was deemed a civic duty and most Dutch civilians became fluent in accounting practices which they learned in publicly funded schools.</p>

<p>The profession spread very slowly over the next centuries, but by the late 19th century it took off. In only 60 years (1870-1930), the number of accountants/book-keepers in the U.S. increased from circa 54,000 workers [U.S. Census Office, 1872, p. 706] to more than 900,000 [U.S. Bureau
 of the Census, 1933, Tables 3, 49].</p>

Courtesty EY.com</div><figcaption>Alwin Ernst (left) did not finish college, instead apprenticing as a bookkeeper and ended up to owning his own accounting firm. Arther Young (right) studied law in Scotland but moved to New York city in 1890 to pursue a career in accounting, eventually starting a firm with his brother. The two men died within days of each other in 1948, never having met. Their firms were later merged into Ernst & Young.</figcaption></figure>


<p>In these days the way you became and accountant was to apprentice as a bookkeeper. Bookkeeping was a respectable profession that could lead to an accounting career and even owning your own business. Under the late 19th century census bookkeeping and accounting were counted as the same profession.</p>

<p>But the mechanization of accounting from 1916-1930 changed this. With new accounting machines in the office, bookkeeping became the routine task of entering data with a machine, while accounting focussed on interpretting the data and making managerial recommendations. Accounting became a profession while bookkeeping became a trade.(Wooden and Kemmerer: U.S. Mechanical Accounting). By the 1920s the census listed them as separate occupations.</p>

Photo courtesy the Early Office Museum</div><figcaption> During the period of mechanization (1916-1930), bookkeeping shifted to women's work that no longer led to an accounting career.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now instead of apprenticing, you went to school and got a degree. The professionalization of accounting kept people out, especially since many colleges did not offer accounting courses to women. Bookkeeping jobs tended to go to women, while the accounting profession was predominantly male.</p>

 <p>Men remained the majority of accountants until 1997, when women took over, accounting for 54 percent of accounting graduates and 51 percent of new hires in public accounting firms (AICPA, 1998). (Hardin-Reding-Stocks, Journal of Managerial Issues Summer 2002)</p>



<figure><img src="images/accounting/woman.jpg"><figcaption>Today the majority of accountants are women. It is still a profession requiring a degree. The profession is in a stage of rebuilding its reputation, which was tarnished in the past few decades due ethical violations by big firms.</figcaption></figure>
