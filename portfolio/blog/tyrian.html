<p>Royal purple - also known as Tyrian purple after the city Tyre - holds the record as the world's most expensive dye.  </p>

<p>As far back as 500 B.C., people of Tyre discovered they could made purple dye from snails. They caught them from the Mediterranean Sea, squeezed the mucus into a basin (a painstaking process) and left it to dry in the sun. Over the course of several days the mucus transformed from clear to purple. Then they added salt-water and, presto, they had dye with which to turn plain clothes into rich purple.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/tyrian_purple_murex_shells.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Tyrian purple dye comes from the mucus of Bolinus brandaris snails.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It was a slow and expensive process. Twelve thousand snails yielded just one gram of dye, enough to dye one handkerchief.</p>

<p> The ordeal made Tyrian purple accessible only to the very rich. Some accounts say it was worth its weight in silver. Others say it was more precious than gold.</p>

<p>It wasn't so much the color of Tyrian purple - a rusty reddish purple that resembles dried blood - that people valued. It was the quality. Tyrian-dyed garments had a luster that, rather than fading, got richer and brighter with weathering and sunlight.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/eII.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Authentic Tyrian purple is not common anymore but it can be seen in St. Edward's crown worn here by Elizabeth II.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Today authentic Tyrian purple is still prohibitively expensive and used less often than manufactured dyes. But its legacy lasts and its slimy origin is the reason purple remains the symbol of royalty.</p>
