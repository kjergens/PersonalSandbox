<p>Royal purple - also known as Tyrian purple after the city Tyre - holds the record as the world's most expensive dye. The story starts with snails. Actually, it starts with snail mucus. </p>

<p>Starting as far back as 500 B.C., people caught snails from the Mediterranean Sea, extracted their mucus, squeezed it into a basin, left it to dry in the sun,  watch the color transform from clear to purple, added salt-water and dyed clothes in it.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/tyrian_purple_murex_shells.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Tyrian purple dye comes from the mucus of Bolinus brandaris snails.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It was a slow and expensive process. It took 12,000 snails to yeild one gram of dye - enough to dye one handkerchief.</p>

<p> The ordeal made Tyrian purple accessible only to the very rich. Some accounts say it was worth its weight in silver. Others say it was more precious than gold.</p>

<p>It wasn't so much the color of Tyrian purple - a rusty reddish purple that resembles dried blood - that people valued. It was the quality. Tyrian-dyed garments had a luster that got richer and brighter with weathering and sunlight, rather than fading like lower quality dyes.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/eII.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Real Tyrian purple is not common anymore but it can be seen in St. Edward's crown worn here by Elizabeth II.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Tyrian purple remained the color of royalty for centuries. Today authentic snail-made Tyrian purple is hard to come by, but its legacy lasts and purple remains the symbol of royalty.</p>
